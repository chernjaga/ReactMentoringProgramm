## Task 1: Core concepts
### Setting up the environment
Create a repository. Install an application created via create-react-app. Commit the changes to repository. Install extensions mentioned in the lecture (react developer tools, etc.)

### Create components in different ways, using:
1. React.CreateElement
2. React.Component
3. React.PureComponent
4. Functional component

## Task-2: Webpack
Create package.json file and install React, Redux, React-Redux, React-Router,
Jest. Install and configure Webpack & Babel to get build artifact by running npm
command.
Set DEV and PROD build configuration. Use env variables, dev server, optimizations for PROD
build. Set up testing. You should have test command in your package.json file, which
will run your future tests. Don’t use any React boilerplate (like create-react-app) for
this task

## Task 3: Components part 1
Write components implementing HTML markup for required design for home page of InVision prototype (Only UI part). For this part, no need to implement API calls and routing, the task can be done with mocked data.
Use <ErrorBoundary> component for catching and displaying errors https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html. You could create one component and wrap all your application or use several components.

## Task 4: Components part 2
Implement markup and styles for “Add movie”, “Edit”, “Delete” modal windows and “sorting”. No need to implement real API calls. Only add pages with mocked data. No need to implement hooks in this task.

## Task 5: Hooks
Implement markup and styles for “Movie details” page.
In your project, change Class components into Functional components and use hooks where applicable.
